# linear_equation-AX-b-solver
Here is **c languague** implementation of the **system of linear equations solver** using very famous method of **Gauss-Jordan elimination**.
With help of this program you can determine whethere given pair of equations have **unique, infinite or no solutions.**


You need to just run the l**inear_equation_solver.c** file and to test it you can use data from **test_data.txt** or you can use your data.
